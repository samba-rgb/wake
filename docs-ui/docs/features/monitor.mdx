# Monitor

Wake provides a comprehensive monitoring feature that allows you to see real-time CPU and memory usage for the pods you are tailing. This feature gives you instant visibility into resource consumption patterns while analyzing logs.

## How to Use Monitor

The monitoring feature is automatically integrated into Wake's interactive UI mode. To access it:

```bash
# Enable monitor in interactive UI mode
wake -n your-namespace pod-selector --ui

# Monitor with specific filters
wake -n apps log-generator --ui -i "ERROR|WARN"

# Monitor all namespaces
wake -A --ui
```

## Key Features

- **Real-time Resource Tracking**: Monitor CPU and memory usage as it happens
- **Pod-level Granularity**: See resource usage for each individual pod
- **Integrated Experience**: Monitoring data appears alongside log streams
- **Performance Insights**: Correlate log patterns with resource consumption
- **Multi-pod Support**: Track resources across multiple pods simultaneously

## What You'll See

The monitor displays:
- **CPU Usage**: Current CPU consumption per pod
- **Memory Usage**: Current memory consumption per pod  
- **Resource Trends**: How usage changes over time
- **Pod Status**: Health and availability indicators

## Use Cases

- **Performance Debugging**: Identify resource spikes during error conditions
- **Capacity Planning**: Understanding normal vs peak resource usage
- **Troubleshooting**: Correlate high resource usage with specific log events
- **Optimization**: Monitor the impact of configuration changes
- **Development**: Real-time feedback during application development

This feature is particularly useful when combined with Wake's advanced filtering capabilities, allowing you to monitor resource usage while filtering for specific log patterns.
