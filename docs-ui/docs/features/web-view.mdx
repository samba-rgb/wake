## 🕐 Timeline View with --since (Web-Only Advantage)

One of the most powerful features of Wake's web view is how the `--since` flag creates a **visual timeline interface** that's impossible to achieve with regular terminal output. This transforms historical log analysis from a linear text stream into an interactive, time-based visualization.

### Why --since is Special in Web View

In terminal mode, `--since` just shows older logs as text. In **web view**, it creates a rich timeline experience:

```bash
# Terminal: Just shows last 2 hours as scrolling text
wake "api-server" --since 2h

# Web View: Creates interactive timeline with visual time navigation  
wake "api-server" --since 2h --web
```

### Timeline Features You Can't Get Elsewhere

#### 📊 **Visual Time Navigation**
- **Timeline scrubber**: Drag to jump to any point in the time range
- **Zoom controls**: Focus on specific time periods with precision
- **Time markers**: Clear visual indicators for different time periods
- **Event density**: See when log activity was highest

#### 📈 **Historical Pattern Analysis** 
```bash
# Analyze error patterns over the last 24 hours
wake -n production "payment-service" --since 24h --web -i "error|exception"

# View deployment timeline over the last 6 hours  
wake "api-.*" --since 6h --web -i "deployment|restart|ready"

# Monitor performance trends over the past week
wake "database" --since 7d --web -i "slow_query|timeout|connection"
```

#### 🎯 **Incident Investigation Timeline**
```bash
# Recreate the full timeline of yesterday's incident
wake -n production --since 1d --web -i "error|warn|fatal"

# Share timeline view with team - they see the SAME visual timeline
# Perfect for post-mortems and root cause analysis
```

### Unique Timeline Capabilities

#### **Time-Range Filtering in UI**
Once logs are in OpenObserve with `--since`, you can:
- **Narrow time windows** without re-running Wake
- **Compare different time periods** side by side  
- **Bookmark specific moments** in the timeline
- **Export timeline segments** for reports

#### **Cross-Pod Timeline Correlation**
```bash
# See how errors propagated across services over time
wake -A "api|database|cache" --since 4h --web -i "error"
```
In the web view, you get:
- **Unified timeline** showing all pods
- **Visual correlation** of when errors started in each service
- **Interactive filtering** to isolate specific timeframes
- **Pattern recognition** across the entire system

#### **Long-Term Historical Analysis**
```bash
# Analyze patterns over extended periods
wake "worker-.*" --since 30d --web -i "failed|retry|timeout"

# Compare performance between different weeks
wake "api-server" --since 14d --web -i "response_time"
```

### Real-World Timeline Scenarios

#### **🚨 Incident Response**
```bash
# During an incident - create shared timeline for the team
wake -n production --since 2h --web -i "error|fatal"
```
**Web Timeline Shows:**
- When the incident started (visual spike in errors)
- Which services were affected first
- How the issue propagated over time
- Team can all see the same timeline view live

#### **🔍 Post-Incident Analysis** 
```bash
# Recreate the full incident timeline for analysis
wake -n production --since 8h --web
```
**Timeline Benefits:**
- **Visual reconstruction** of events leading to incident
- **Export timeline** for incident reports  
- **Share exact timeline view** with stakeholders
- **Compare with previous incidents** using saved timeline bookmarks

#### **📊 Performance Trend Analysis**
```bash
# Weekly performance patterns
wake "api-.*" --since 7d --web -i "latency|response_time"
```
**Timeline Reveals:**
- Daily traffic patterns
- Weekly performance cycles  
- Gradual performance degradation over time
- Peak usage periods and their impact

### Timeline vs. Regular --since

| Feature | Terminal `--since` | Web Timeline `--since` |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **View Type** | Linear text scroll | Interactive visual timeline |
| **Time Navigation** | Scroll through text | Click/drag to any time point |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Manual text analysis | Visual spikes and trends |
| **Sharing** | Copy/paste text | Share live timeline URL |
| **Multi-Pod Correlation** | Mixed text output | Unified visual timeline |
| **Time Range Adjustment** | Re-run command | Adjust in UI instantly |
| **Export** | Text file only | Timeline segments + visualizations |
| **Team Collaboration** | Send log files | Shared live timeline view |

### Advanced Timeline Commands

```bash
# Extended historical analysis with web timeline
wake "critical-service" --since 30d --web -i "error" 
# Creates 30-day timeline - impossible to analyze effectively in terminal

# Multi-namespace incident timeline  
wake -A --since 6h --web -i "error|warn|fatal"
# Unified timeline across all namespaces

# Performance baseline establishment
wake "api-.*" --since 7d --web -i "latency|cpu|memory"
# Week-long performance timeline for baseline analysis

# Deployment impact timeline
wake "app" --since 24h --web -i "deploy|restart|ready|error"
# Full deployment lifecycle in visual timeline
```

### Pro Tips for Timeline Analysis

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Use `--since 24h` to see the big picture, then narrow time windows in the UI
2. **Combine with Filtering**: Use `-i` patterns to focus timeline on specific events
3. **Save Timeline Bookmarks**: Bookmark important incidents for future reference
4. **Export Timeline Data**: Use OpenObserve's export for reports and documentation
5. **Team Sharing**: Share timeline URLs instead of log files for better collaboration

The timeline view created by `--since` in web mode transforms Wake from a log viewer into a **time-travel debugging tool** that lets you visually navigate through your application's history. This is simply impossible to achieve with terminal-based log viewing!
