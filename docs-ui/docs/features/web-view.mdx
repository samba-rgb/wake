# Web View (with OpenObserve)

Wake's web view feature transforms your Kubernetes log analysis from a terminal-only experience into a powerful, shareable web-based interface. By integrating with OpenObserve, Wake enables teams to collaborate on log analysis, share findings, and maintain historical log data for comprehensive troubleshooting.

## What is Web View?

The web view feature allows Wake to send filtered logs to a web-based observability platform (OpenObserve), where they can be viewed, searched, and analyzed through a modern browser interface. This bridges the gap between Wake's powerful command-line filtering capabilities and the need for team collaboration and data persistence.

## Key Features & Benefits

### 🌐 Browser-Based Access
- **Modern Web Interface**: Access logs through any modern web browser with a clean, intuitive UI
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live log updates appear instantly in the web interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Cross-Platform**: Access from any operating system without installing Wake

### 👥 Team Collaboration
- **Shareable URLs**: Generate permanent links to specific log views and share with team members
- **Multi-User Access**: Multiple team members can view the same logs simultaneously
- **Role-Based Access**: Configure different access levels for different team members
- **Remote Debugging**: Support remote team members and on-call engineers

### 📊 Data Persistence & Analysis
- **Historical Storage**: Logs are stored for extended periods (configurable retention)
- **Advanced Querying**: Use OpenObserve's powerful search and filtering capabilities
- **Custom Dashboards**: Create monitoring dashboards with log metrics and visualizations
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns and trends over time periods

### 🔄 Seamless Integration
- **Wake Compatibility**: All Wake filtering patterns work in the web interface
- **Kubernetes Metadata**: Automatic pod, namespace, and container labeling
- **Multi-Format Support**: JSON logs, plain text, and structured data
- **Export Options**: Download filtered logs in various formats

### 📱 Enhanced Accessibility
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Check logs from mobile devices during incidents
- **Offline Capability**: View previously loaded logs even when disconnected
- **Search History**: Keep track of frequently used queries and filters
- **Bookmark Support**: Save important log views for quick access

## Use Cases

### 🚨 Incident Response
```bash
# Quickly share critical errors with the team
wake -n production api-* --web -i "FATAL|ERROR" 
# Team can immediately access the same filtered view via web URL
```

### 🔍 Collaborative Debugging
```bash
# Multiple developers investigating the same issue
wake -n staging payment-service --web -i "transaction.*failed"
# Everyone sees the same real-time log stream in their browsers
```

### 📈 Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Long-term performance analysis
wake -n production --web -i "response_time|latency"
# Data persisted for historical trend analysis
```

### 📋 Documentation & Reporting
- **Evidence Collection**: Capture logs for bug reports and post-mortems
- **Performance Reports**: Generate reports with log data and metrics
- **Compliance**: Maintain audit trails with timestamped log data

## How It Works

1. **Wake captures logs** from your Kubernetes pods with all its powerful filtering
2. **Logs are sent to OpenObserve** via HTTP API in real-time
3. **OpenObserve stores and indexes** the logs for fast searching
4. **Web interface provides** rich visualization and collaboration features
5. **Team members access** via shared URLs with real-time updates

## Installation & Setup

Now let's get the web view feature up and running:

### Installing Docker

To use OpenObserve with Wake's web view feature, you'll need Docker installed. Choose one of these options based on your platform:

#### For Mac Users

**Option 1: Docker Desktop (Recommended)**
- **Download**: [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Features**: GUI interface, automatic updates, integrated Kubernetes
- **Requirements**: macOS 10.15 or later

```bash
# Install via Homebrew (recommended)
brew install --cask docker
```

**Option 2: Rancher Desktop (Open Source)**
- **Download**: [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)
- **Features**: Open source, built-in Kubernetes, choice of container runtime

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install --cask rancher
```

**Option 3: OrbStack (Lightweight)**
- **Download**: [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/)
- **Features**: Faster performance, lower resource usage

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install --cask orbstack
```

#### For Linux Users

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo dnf install docker

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S docker

# Start Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

#### Verify Installation
```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Test Docker functionality
docker run hello-world
```

### Setup Steps

#### Step 1: Prepare Data Directory

```bash
mkdir -p data
chmod +x data
```

#### Step 2: Start OpenObserve with Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name openobserve \
  -v $PWD/data:/data \
  -p 5080:5080 \
  -e ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL="root@example.com" \
  -e ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD="Complexpass#123" \
  -e ZO_COMPACT_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=3 \
  -e ZO_ORG_DATA_QUOTA=10737418240 \
  -e ZO_STREAM_DATA_QUOTA=2147483648 \
  public.ecr.aws/zinclabs/openobserve:latest
```

**What this does:**
- `-d` – Run in background
- `--name openobserve` – Container name for easy management
- `-v $PWD/data:/data` – Mount local data directory for persistence
- `-p 5080:5080` – Expose port 5080 for web UI
- `-e ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL` – Set login email
- `-e ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD` – Set login password
- `-e ZO_COMPACT_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=3` – Keep data for 3 days
- `-e ZO_ORG_DATA_QUOTA=10737418240` – 10GB organization quota
- `-e ZO_STREAM_DATA_QUOTA=2147483648` – 2GB per stream quota

#### Step 3: Verify OpenObserve is Running

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps | grep openobserve

# View logs
docker logs -f openobserve
```

Once running, access OpenObserve at: [http://localhost:5080/](http://localhost:5080/)

#### Step 4: Configure Wake to use OpenObserve

:::info Note
These are the default configuration values. You **only need to run these commands if you want to change them**. If you're using the default OpenObserve setup, you can skip this step.
:::

```bash
wake setconfig web.endpoint "http://localhost:5080"
wake setconfig web.user "root@example.com"
wake setconfig web.password "Complexpass#123"
```

## Getting Started with Web View

Once OpenObserve is running, you can start sending logs to the web interface:

```bash
# Basic web output
wake -n apps log-generator --web

# Combine with local UI for dual output
wake -n apps log-generator --ui --web

# Advanced filtering with web output
wake -n production api-* --web -i "ERROR|WARN"

# Save to file and web simultaneously
wake "my-app" --web -w /tmp/logs.txt
```

## Best Practices

1. **Index Strategy**: Use appropriate indexing for frequently queried fields
2. **Retention Management**: Set appropriate retention periods for different log types
3. **Query Optimization**: Use efficient filters to reduce query overhead
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor OpenObserve resource usage

The web view feature makes Wake's powerful log analysis capabilities accessible to broader teams while maintaining the performance and filtering capabilities that make Wake unique.
