## Getting Started

To use the web view feature, Wake integrates with OpenObserve to provide a browser-based log viewing experience:

```bash
# Start Wake with web output to OpenObserve
wake -n apps log-generator --web

# Combine web view with local UI
wake -n apps log-generator --ui --web

# Web view with advanced filtering
wake -n production api-* --web -i "ERROR|WARN"
```

## Key Features

### Web-Based Access
- **Browser Interface**: Access logs through any modern web browser
- **Real-time Updates**: Live log streaming in the web interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Shareable URLs**: Share specific log views with team members

### Integration Benefits
- **OpenObserve Integration**: Seamless connection with OpenObserve infrastructure
- **Persistent Storage**: Logs stored for historical analysis
- **Advanced Querying**: Use OpenObserve's powerful query capabilities
- **Dashboards**: Create custom dashboards for monitoring

### Multi-Format Support
- **JSON Logs**: Native support for structured JSON log formats
- **Plain Text**: Traditional text-based logs
- **Kubernetes Metadata**: Automatic pod, namespace, and container labeling
- **Timestamps**: Precise timing information for all log entries

## Use Cases

### Team Collaboration
```bash
# Share real-time logs with development team
wake -n staging api-* --web -i "deployment"

# Collaborative debugging sessions
wake -n production --web --sample 5
```

### Historical Analysis
- **Log Retention**: Keep logs for extended periods
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns over time
- **Incident Investigation**: Review logs from past incidents
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track application behavior over time

### Remote Access

- **On-Call Support**: Quick access to production logs during incidents
- **Mobile Access**: Check logs from mobile devices
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any operating system with a browser

## Configuration

### OpenObserve Setup
Wake integrates with OpenObserve for web-based log viewing. The integration handles:
- **Automatic Index Creation**: Creates appropriate indexes for your logs
- **Schema Management**: Handles log structure and field mapping
- **Authentication**: Secure access to your log data
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies

### Network Configuration
```bash
# Configure OpenObserve endpoint
wake setconfig openobserve_endpoint "http://localhost:5080"

# Set authentication credentials
wake setconfig openobserve_org "your-org"
wake setconfig openobserve_stream "wake-logs"
```

## Advanced Features

### Real-time Filtering
- **Live Queries**: Apply filters in real-time through the web interface
- **Pattern Matching**: Use Wake's advanced pattern syntax in web queries
- **Multi-pod Aggregation**: View logs from multiple pods in unified timeline
- **Resource Correlation**: Correlate logs with CPU/memory metrics

### Export and Sharing
- **Export Options**: Download filtered logs in various formats
- **Permalink Generation**: Create permanent links to specific log views
- **Dashboard Integration**: Embed log views in monitoring dashboards
- **API Access**: Programmatic access to stored log data

## Best Practices

1. **Index Strategy**: Use appropriate indexing for frequently queried fields
2. **Retention Management**: Set appropriate retention periods for different log types
3. **Query Optimization**: Use efficient filters to reduce query overhead
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor OpenObserve resource usage

The web view feature makes Wake's powerful log analysis capabilities accessible to broader teams while maintaining the performance and filtering capabilities that make Wake unique.
