# Interactive UI Mode

Wake features a powerful interactive terminal UI (TUI) that allows dynamic filtering and real-time log viewing across multiple Kubernetes pods. The TUI provides an immersive experience for debugging and monitoring applications in real-time.

<InteractiveUITut />

## Getting Started

To use the interactive UI, add the `--ui` flag to any Wake command:

```bash
# Basic interactive mode
wake --ui

# Interactive mode with namespace selection
wake -n kube-system --ui

# Interactive mode with pod selector
wake -n apps log-generator --ui

# Interactive mode with initial filters
wake -n apps log-generator --ui -i "ERROR|WARN" -E "debug"
```

## Key Features

- **Real-time Log Streaming**: Watch logs as they happen across multiple pods
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Apply include/exclude patterns without restarting
- **Pattern History**: Navigate through previously used filter patterns with arrow keys
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of filter changes and their effects
- **Smart Scrolling**: Auto-scroll to bottom with manual scroll support
- **Multi-pod Support**: View logs from multiple pods simultaneously
- **Resource Monitoring**: Built-in CPU and memory monitoring (when available)
- **Help System**: Built-in help accessible with the `h` key

## Navigation Controls

### Filter Management
- **`i`**: Edit include pattern (show only logs matching this pattern)
- **`e`**: Edit exclude pattern (hide logs matching this pattern)
- **`↑/↓`**: Navigate through pattern history

### Display Controls
- **`h`**: Toggle help screen
- **`r`**: Refresh display
- **`q` / `Esc`**: Quit application

### Scrolling
- **`↑/↓` or `k/j`**: Scroll through logs line by line
- **`Home/Ctrl+g`**: Go to top of logs
- **`End/G`**: Go to bottom of logs
- **`Page Up/Down`**: Scroll by page

## Advanced Usage

### Combined with File Output
```bash
# Save logs to file while using interactive UI
wake -n apps log-generator --ui -w logs.txt
```

### With Resource Monitoring
```bash
# Enable interactive UI with monitoring
wake -n production api-* --ui --monitor
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# Show internal Wake logs alongside application logs
wake -n apps log-generator --ui --dev
```

## Smart Filter Management

Wake intelligently handles filter changes in the TUI:

- **Preserved History**: Changing filters doesn't remove previously displayed logs
- **Visual Boundaries**: Clear markers show when filters were applied
- **Incremental Filtering**: New filters only affect incoming logs
- **Pattern Memory**: Previously used patterns are saved and accessible

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with minimal filters and narrow down as needed
2. **Use Pattern History**: Press `↑/↓` in filter mode to reuse previous patterns
3. **Combine with Sampling**: Use `--sample N` to limit the number of pods for better performance
4. **Save Important Logs**: Use `-w filename.txt` to save filtered logs to a file
5. **Monitor Resources**: Keep an eye on CPU/memory usage to identify performance issues

The interactive UI is particularly powerful when debugging complex issues across multiple microservices or when you need to correlate log patterns with resource usage.
